Hello folks, visitors, coders, viewers... My name is Hector, i am an embedded systems engineer. I like developping with microcontrolers (C, C++ language), as well as
interfaces (Java, C#, a bit of LabView). I use git mainly to contribute to school and work projects. 

Looking forward to:
  => Exchange and collaborate! :)
  => Learn new things (seeking to improve on cybersecurity, hardware security, signal treatment, FPGA design... and a lot more)
  => Start some new projects!
